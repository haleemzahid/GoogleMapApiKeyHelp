# GoogleMapApiKeyHelp
Hi, I am using [react-google-maps](https://github.com/visgl/react-google-maps) library in a react tauri application. Currently, the Photorealistic 3D Maps JavaScript API supports manual Ctrl+mouse drag interactions for smooth camera movement (tilt, pan, rotate). However, I am not able to achieve that programmatically. I would appreciate if you could help me. I tried to change the tilt, heading, center, altitude, but I am not able to achive the desired camera movement, even the camera movement is not available in the built-in buttons. You can check the relevant files in this repo

**Use Case**:
Building custom navigation controls (joysticks, directional pads, gamepads) that provide the same smooth user experience as native mouse controls just like Google Earth Pro.
